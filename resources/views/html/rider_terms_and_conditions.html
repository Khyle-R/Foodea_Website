        <h1 class="text-center fw-bold">TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h1>

                <div class="terms-text"><br>
                  <p>Published: 01 / 30 / 2023</p>
                  <p>Greetings Users,</p>
                  <h6>Clearly Describe Your Services and Products</h6>

                      <p>All businesses should include in their terms and conditions
                        a description of the services and products they offer their
                        customers. The smaller the business, the greater the need for
                        a more specific description of its services and products.
                        In addition to providing clarity, specific descriptions help
                        to avoid issues arising from customers expecting more than
                        your business offers for a given fee.</p>
                      
                  <h6>Terms of Payment</h6>
                      <p>Your terms of payment should include prices, late payment
                        fees or interest, returned check surcharges, and so on.</p>
                  
                  <h6>Guarantees or Warranties</h6>
                      <p>A guarantee or warranty reassures your customers of the
                        quality of your services or products. Guarantees and
                        warranties should also be time-specific so that you won't
                        have to deal with a refund request five years after rendering
                        a service or delivering a product. Settle for a realistic and
                        suitable timeline for your business, such as 30 days or 12 months.</p>

                  <h6>Limitations due to Liability</h6>
                      <p>It is not a safe practice to offer guarantees and warranties in
                        a high-risk industry. Instead, businesses should disclaim warranties
                        to minimize liability.</p>

                  <h6>Refund Policy</h6>
                      <p>Retail businesses typically have different refund policies.
                        A refund policy is usually given its own webpage on e-commerce sites.
                        Service contracts sometimes don't include refund options. Wherever the
                        refund policy of your business occurs, make sure it's consistent.
                        Otherwise, courts will rule against you in the event of a lawsuit.</p>

                  <h6>Timelines for Delivery</h6>
                      <p>Delivery timelines depend on the kind of service or products you sell.
                        There are deadlines for services and scheduled delivery dates for
                        products. Agree on a deadline or delivery date only if you're sure
                        you can hold up your end of the bargain.</p>

                  <h6>Privacy Policy</h6>
                      <p>If your business involves personally identifiable information,
                        it needs a privacy policy as much as it needs terms and conditions.
                        It's also good practice to make reference to confidentiality or
                        privacy in the terms and conditions. However, nothing can take the
                        place of a full-blown privacy policy in a business that involves
                        sensitive information.</p>

                  <h6>Solutions for a Breach</h6>
                        <p>A breach of agreement can come in various forms including but
                          not limited to the following:

                          - Poor-quality products and services
                          - Failure to pay for satisfactory goods or services
                          - Making a refund request after the expiry of valid timelines
                          - Delivery of damaged goods
                          - Refund procedures are used to solve the problem of rendering
                          substandard services or delivering poor-quality products. Another
                          remedy is to indicate preferred methods of dispute resolution.
                          It's best for small businesses to avoid expensive lawsuits and
                          use optional dispute resolution methods.
                          
                          For instance, the terms and conditions of some businesses specify
                          that all disputes are to be resolved by arbitration and that
                          customers are required to waive their rights to a court trial.
                          Sometimes even the venue and applicable rules of the arbitration
                          process are specified. Specifying arbitration or mediation as a
                          means of dispute resolution can save your business unnecessary legal fees.</p>

                  <h6>Agreement Termination</h6>
                      <p>Agreement termination clauses define how the business relationship
                        that is stated in the terms and conditions should come to a close.
                        They typically state that termination takes place by unanimous
                        agreement or on the condition that a party notifies other parties
                        of their intent to terminate 30 days before the effective date.

                        Some businesses describe their exact agreement termination process.
                        Agreement termination clauses prepare business owners for contract
                        terminations. That way, businesses aren't taken by surprise and are
                        prepared to replace lost deals with new ones.</p>

                  <h6>Governing Laws</h6>
                      <p>Adding governing laws to your company's terms and conditions is a
                        good practice, especially if your services or products are not limited
                        by location. For instance, if you deal with goods that are shipped
                        across the country or overseas, you should indicate that all disputes
                        will be settled close to home by limiting the jurisdictions where customer
                        complaints can be made.

                        Typically, a footnote in the section for dispute resolution or a
                        miscellaneous section can serve this purpose. It is best to choose the
                        home jurisdiction of your business for dispute resolution in order to
                        save costs in case of a dispute.

                        If you need help with example of terms and conditions of a business,
                        post your legal need at UpCounsel's marketplace. UpCounsel accepts only
